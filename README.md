# FPV Drone PCB Full PCB + Assembly - Work in Progress

A comprehensive open-source avionics ecosystem for FPV drones featuring a completed flight computer PCB along with in-development power distribution and electronic speed controller PCB. This project delivers an avionics stack for a custom drone with full schematic and PCB files available on KiCad 9.0.

## Overview

This project aims to create a FPV drone with a custom all-in-one (AIO) PCB that combines the flight controller, power distribution, and ESC functionality. Built around the STM32F411CEU6 microcontroller, this drone follows BetaFlight and AM32 design requirements while providing a clean and efficient build.

 **Integrated PCB Design**
  - Flight Controller: STM32F411CEU6 (ARM Cortex M4)
  - Power Distribution: High-current paths with filtering
  - ESC: AM32 compatible 4-in-1 design
  - 
 **Connectivity**
  - All peripherals utilize SPI for high-speed sensor communication
  - USB-C, JTAG, SWD
  - UART port for external peripheral
  - Backup Coin Cell Battery Port
  - FTDI programming interface

<ins>**Flight Controller Board**</ins>
- STM32F411CEU6 microcontroller
- 12MHz external crystal oscillator
- ICM-42605 gyroscope/accelerometer
- BMP280 barometer for altitude hold
- L86-M33 GPS for postional tracking
- SX 1276 LoRa 915MHz Transciever NiceRF Module
- Power options, USB-C, LDO and External 3.3V Connection

<ins>**Power and ESC Board**</ins>

**Power System**
- SWD Flash
- DC-DC buck converter for efficient power regulation
- Support for 3S-4S LiPo batteries (11.1V-16.8V)
- XT-60 connector for battery input
- Electric Speed Controller for four BLDC motors

**ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)**
- AM32 compatible
- 30A motor capability
- Thermal management design
 

## Software Compatibility

This drone design is compatible with:
- BetaFlight (recommended for racing/freestyle)
- INAV (for GPS functions)
- Ardupilot (for autonomous capabilities)
- AM32 (for ESC functionality)


### Bill of Materials

| Component | Description | Specification |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Frame | 3D printed carbon fiber | 5" freestyle/racing frame |
| Motors | Brushless | SpeedyBee 1800KV (recommended) |
| Battery | LiPo | 4S 1500mAh 100C (recommended) |
| Propellers | 5-inch | Matched to motor and frame |
| Camera | FPV | CCD or CMOS based on preference |
| Video Transmitter | 5.8GHz | Power output based on needs |
| Receiver | Radio control | Compatible with SX1276 LoRa Transciever |
| LoRa Antenna | 915MHz |SMA compatible half-dipole antenna|

### Tools
- Soldering iron and solder
- Heat shrink tubing
- Hex drivers/screwdrivers
- LiPo battery charger
- Multimeter
- KiCAD for PCB design modifications
- Zip ties
- Double-sided foam tape

### Electronics Knowledge
- Basic soldering skills
- Understanding of power systems
- Familiarity with microcontrollers
- Ability to flash firmware

## Calculations

### Power System
- Max Current = 4 motors × 30A = 120A
- Required C Rating = 120A / 1.5Ah = 80C minimum
- Flight time estimate = (1500mAh) ÷ (Average current draw) × 60 × 0.8

### Weight Budget
- Target all-up-weight: ~500g (5" freestyle quad)
- Battery weight: ~120-150g (4S 1500mAh)
- Component weight distribution accordingly

## Testing Procedures

1. Power system verification (voltage output, regulation)
2. Motor/ESC testing with oscillosocpe
3. Sensor calibration and verification
4. Radio range and failsafe testing
5. Controlled hover tests
6. Full flight testing
